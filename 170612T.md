Private blockchains are needed for organizations as organizations do not want to spend money on the mining process in public blockchains(like Ethereum), and they do not want their data to be shared with everyone.

1. I learnt about the importance of subnets(channels in Fabric). This concept facilitates to use the same blockchain for different tasks within different sets of organizations.

2. Also, I learnt about smart contracts(chaincode in Fabric). This concept can be used to introduce programmes to the blockchain so that organizations can do asset transactions in different ways.
